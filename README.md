This project consists of my solutions for Leetcode(https://leetcode.com/problems).

## USAGE
This solutions mainly written in Ruby language. You can search the solution by search keywords.
Most of those files are named in following format: ${Leetcode_method_name}_${some_notations}.rb
Please feel free to use them for learning. I am happy if them are helpful.
Due to question number is unstable so I ignored it.


All source codes are my original works, except some files which have been acknowledged.
So, some solutions are working in a tricky way and some others are worked ineffectively.
Please feel free to issue it!
